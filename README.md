# HANGMAN-PROJECT
HANGMAN PROJECT IS A GAME IN WHICH WE HAVE TO GUESS THE WORD WHICH IS RANDOMLY PROVIDED BY THE COMPUTER ON ITS OWN INTERNAL CALCULATION.
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or 
more players. One player thinks of a word and the other tries 
to guess it by suggesting the letters. The word to guess is 
represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters. 
If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the 
word, the program writes it in all its correct positions. If the 
suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player 
draws one element of the hangman diagram as a tally mark. 
The game is over when:
The guessing player completes the word, or guesses the 
whole word correctly and the players loses when the 
hangman is completed fully
